\section{Finding a Similar Actor}

Say you want to make a movie with a specific actor as the lead role, but the actor is unavailable. You have already written the script, and found all the other actors. The only thing missing is the lead actor. \\

You find a similar actor. You find the most similar actor. And for this we must assume that, what defines an actor, is what movies it appears in. So you find the actor that has the most movies in common with your intended actor, and use that actor instead. \\

For solving this problem we have created an algorithm that does similarity search through the \emph{IMDB database} and implemented different approximation schemes to make the process faster.


\section{Implementation}
\begin{mdframed}[hidealllines=true,backgroundcolor=blue!20]
We assume that there is a high correlation between the distinct roles in a movie and the rating the movie receives. Because the success of an actor is dependent on, whether he or she appears in high ranked movies, therefore movies with $rank \leq 7.0$ is purged from the data. Are we keeping our original problem?
\end{mdframed}
We will look at the naïve solution, then \emph{MinHashing}, and then \emph{Locality Sensitive Hashing}, this is part one of the report. After that we will implement \emph{b-bit} and \emph{odd sketch}, which is the extension to our report.


\subsection{Measuring similarity}
Since a role is represented as a set movies, we can measure the similarity between roles using the Jaccard similarity, where the similarity between two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$.

\begin{equation}
Sim(S_1, S_2) = \frac{|S_1 \cap S_2|}{|S_1 \cup S_2|}
\end{equation}
The Jaccard index falls in the range of 0-1. It is 1 if the sets are similar, and it is 0 if the sets are disjoint.


\subsection{Measuring Running Time}
For every new implementation, we will measure the actual running time. It will be measured on a normal laptop computer with 8GB RAM and and intel i5 quadcore. Though, if the running time is taking longer than out patience permits, we will just put in how long we waited, and note that we did not run it through.

We will also create some random dummy data to run. This way we will be able to graph the running times, and look at the tendency curves. In the dummy data, there are 10 times as many roles, as there are movies. This corresponds pretty well with the \emph{imdb-r.txt} file, which has 57,736 distinct movies, and 553,263 distinct roles (not counting the movies without any roles and roles with nonexisting movie-ids).

But even though there are 10 more roles per movies. Many of these roles are only in one movie, and only few roles are in many movies. If we calculate the average number of movies, that a role appears in, it is somewhere between 1.2 and 2.0, depending on what our cut-off rank is (see figure ~\ref{fig:sparsenesscutoff}. We have defined our minimum rank cutoff to movies with at least 7.0 in rank, which corresponds to an average of 1.7 movies per role. This has influence on the characteristic matrix, that we create when parsing.

This will be taken into account when creating our random dummy data.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \input{plots/ones_per_role.tex}
        \caption{Sparseness with cutoff}
        \label{fig:sparsenesscutoff}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Naïve Implementation}

\subsubsection{Data representation}
A role is represented as a list of movies\footnote{Corresponding to the ids of the movies, which is integers} the specific role appear in.

\begin{equation}
r_1 = \{m_1, m_2, m_3, \ldots , m_i\}
\end{equation}

The data is stored in a characteristic matrix, where the rows are movies and the columns are roles.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\begin{eqnarray*}
 & n \ \text{roles} \\
 m \ \text{movies} = & 
\begin{cases}
    \overbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
        1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
        1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
        1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix} 
    }
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray*}
\caption{The characteristic matrix}
\label{fig:char_matrix}
\end{figure}

To save space in memory, we do not save the matrix as it is seen in ~\ref{fig:char_matrix}. We save a list of the pairs that have a 1 in common, as suggested in \cite{book:mmds} p. 81. Worst case, the space consumption would be $O(n \times m)$ \ \footnote{If every role was in every movie}, but since we have a very sparse characteristic matrix, we save a lot of space doing this. \\

Because we have to permute every possible pair of roles, the running time is $O(n^2 \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of distinct roles, and $m$ is the number of movies. In a scenario where $m$ is almost equal to $n$, the runtime will be $O(n^3)$. \\

This will surely not fit in memory with the whole dataset, so more sofisticated algorithms are needed. \\

\subsubsection{Actual Running Time}
The actual running time with the naïve implementation takes too long for our normal laptop computer to outrun our patience. We ran the implementation on random dummy datasets, which can be seen in figure ~\ref{fig:naive_at}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{center}
        \input{plots/naive_at.tex}
        \caption{Naïve Implementation Actual Times}
        \label{fig:naive_at}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{MinHashing}
Since the permutation of such a large matrix is infeasible, we create a number of hash functions, $h_1, ..., h_k$, which should be less than the number of rows in the characteristic matrix. To compare sets of documents, the normal procedure is to convert them into shingles. But since the "documents" we are working on, are actual sets of index numbers, there is no need for us to use shingles. \\

Remarkably, the probability that the minhash function produces the same value for two sets is the same as the Jaccard similarity of the two sets (p. 82 in \cite{book:mmds}). Let \\

    $x = $ the rows in which the two sets both have a 1. \\
    $y = $ the rows in which one of the sets have a 1. \\
    $z = $ the rows in which none of the sets have a 1. \\

Then the probability of having found a row in $x$, for a random permutation, is

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{x}{x+y}
\end{equation*}

which is equals to the Jaccard similarity of the two sets.

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{S_1 \cap S_2}{S_1 \cup S_2} = \frac{x}{x+y}
\end{equation*}
    
We simulate $k$ random permutations by creating $k$ number of random hash functions \footnote{We are using universal hashing ($(ax + b) \bmod p$) as our hashing functions, where there will be some collisions in the hashes. Some row indexes will be hashed to the same, but as long as $k$ is large it is not important (p. 83-84 in \cite{book:mmds}).}. All row indices are then hashed with all these hash functions, to simulate a permutation. When this is done, we have created the signature matrix, which is a $k\times n$ matrix, that contains the minimum value of $h(x)$, where $x$ is an element in $S$. See figure ~\ref{fig:signature_matrix}\\

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \begin{eqnarray*}
     & n \ \text{signatures} \\
     k \ \text{permutations} = & 
        \begin{cases}
        \overbrace{
        \begin{bmatrix}
            1 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 3 & 6 & 4\\
            3 & 3 & 1 & 5 & 3 & 2 & 1\\
            4 & 3 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
            0 & 1 & 4 & 2 & 2 & 6 & 1\\
        \end{bmatrix} 
        } 
        \end{cases}
    \end{eqnarray*}
    \caption{Signature matrix}
    \label{fig:signature_matrix}
\end{figure}

We still have to permute all pairs of roles, but the number of comparisons is reduced to $k$, the new running time is therefore $O(n^2 \cdot k)$ compared to $O(n^2 \cdot m)$ of the naïve solution, see figure ~\ref{fig:char_matrix} versus ~\ref{fig:signature_matrix}.

\subsection{Actual Running Times}
In figure ~\ref{fig:minhashing_at} the actual running times can be seen.

\begin{equation}
    \text {S-curve equation} = 1 - (1 - s^r)^b 
\end{equation}
\end{figure}


\section{Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)}
Locality sensitive hashing is a way of coping with an even larger amount of data than MinHashing can. So if the number of pairs is too large, LSH is an option to use. We take the signatures produced by min hashing and chop them up into shorter vectors by dividing the total number of rows into $b$ bands of $r$ rows. We then hash the vectors into a large number of buckets. If 2 vectors hash to the same bucket there is a good chance that they are similar. These vectors become candidate pairs, and we only compare candidate pairs for similarity. This leaves us with a significant fraction of the original set of pairs to check. \\

In figure \ref{fig:lsh_buckets} the signature matrix from earlier has been dissected into 2 bands. These bands have, in this example, the same number of buckets as there are signatures. The buckets containing 2 or more signatures have been marked in green. If a signature is in one or more buckets it is a candidate signature to be checked for similarity, whereas if a signature is only in red buckets, which have only one or zero signatures, it is discarded as a candidate signature. \\

So the candidate signatures are $S_0, S_1, S_3, S_4, S_6$, and the discarded signatures are $S_2, S_5$.

\subsection{Analysis}
In the worst case example, we would get all pairs to be candidate pairs, and the time complexity would be $O(n^2)$ in LSH. But to get to LSH, we would have to do MinHashing first, to get the signature matrix, and MinHashing has a time complexity of $O(n^2k)$. Hopefully, we can discard many signatures away, so we only have a fraction as candidate pairs. By looking at the variables $b$ and $r$, we can calculate the probability $s$ that two signatures become a candidate pair. \\

In some problems, it is important to have no false negatives, or no false positives. In these problems the threshold can be chosen lower or higher, to match the wanted ratio. We can plot the probability of a particular pair becoming a candidate pair by using the S-curve equation, see figure \ref{fig:scurve} for the plot.

\begin{equation}
    \text {S-curve equation} = 1 - (1 - s^r)^b 
\end{equation}\\

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \begin{center}
        \input{plots/scurve.tex}
        \caption{S-curve}
        \label{fig:scurve}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We choose our similarity threshold, $t$, on the x-axis of the S-curve graph. If we want to hit a $1:1$ ratio between false positives and false negatives, our threshold should be approximately where the S-curve is the steepest. We then use equation \ref{eq:s-estimate}, and set $r$, and $b$ accordingly, to find an $s$ value close to our threshold $t$.

\begin{equation}
    s = (1/b)^{1/r}
    \label{eq:s-estimate}
\end{equation}



%How much accuracy do we sacrifice in percent?\\

\section{B-bit}
B-bit min hashing is a way to estimate set similarity in a more storage efficient way than with min hashing alone. It is a modification for min hashing.

\subsection{The Variance-Space tradeoff}
\todo{(variance = how much a set of numbers are spread out. small variance - the points are close to the mean and each other. high variance - the points are spread out and around the mean. Min egen husker)}

The variance in our project is a measure of how accurate our results are. So what do we find most important? Accuracy or saving space. What is feasable on a normal pc? The idea is to use 1 or 2 bits to store a sample instead of 64. So on a good day this means we can store 64 times as many samples when converting to 1 bit. So what we loose in accuracy when converting from 64 bits to 1 bit we make up in the amount of samples it is possible to check. This is the tradeoff. This is a bit fluffy but it can be precisely quantified by the storage factor. 

\begin{equation}
    \text {Storage factor} = B(b;R,r_1,r_2)
\end{equation}\\
