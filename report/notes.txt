LSH:

We can use the same hash function for all the bands, but we use a separate bucket array for each band, so columns with the same vector in different bands will not hash to the same bucket.

We shall normally assume that two vectors hash to the same bucket if and only if they are identical.

Random hash function that maps row numbers to as many buckets as there are rows. A hash function that maps integers 0, 1, . . . , k − 1 to bucket numbers 0 through k − 1 typically will map some pairs of integers to the same bucket and leave other buckets unfilled. However, the difference is unimportant as long as k is large and there are not too many collisions. We can maintain the fiction that our hash function h “permutes” row r to position h(r) in the permuted order.
